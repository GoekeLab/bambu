***bambu*** is a R package for multi-sample transcript discovery and quantification using long read RNA-Seq data. You can use ***bambu*** after read alignment to obtain expression estimates for known and novel transcripts and genes. The output from ***bambu*** can directly be used for visualisation and downstream analysis such as differential gene expression or transcript usage.

### Installation

You can install ***bambu*** from bioconductor:
```rscript
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("bambu")
```

---

### General Usage 

The default mode to run ***bambu** is using a set of aligned reads (bam files), reference genome annotations (gtf file, TxDb object, or bambuAnnotation object), and reference genome sequence (fasta file or BSgenome). ***bambu*** will return a summarizedExperiment object with the genomic coordinates for annotated and new transcripts and transcript expression estimates.

We highly recommend to use the same annotations that were used for genome alignment. If you have a gtf file and fasta file you can run ***bambu*** with the following options:

```rscript
test.bam <- system.file("extdata", "SGNex_A549_directRNA_replicate5_run1_chr9_1_1000000.bam", package = "bambu")
  
fa.file <- system.file("extdata", "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly_chr9_1_1000000.fa", package = "bambu")

gtf.file <- system.file("extdata", "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.91_chr9_1_1000000.gtf", package = "bambu")

bambuAnnotations <- prepareAnnotations(gtf.file)

se <- bambu(reads = test.bam, annotations = bambuAnnotations, genome = fa.file)

```


**Quantification of annotated transcripts and genes only (no transcript/gene discovery)**

```rscript
bambu(reads = test.bam, annotations = txdb, genome = fa.file, discovery = FALSE)
```

**Large sample number/ limited memory**     
For larger sample numbers we recommend to write the processed data to a file:

```rscript
bambu(reads = test.bam, rcOutDir = "./bambu/", annotations = bambuAnnotations, genome = fa.file)
```
---


### Use precalculated annotation objects

You can also use precalculated annotations.

If you plan to run ***bambu*** more frequently, we recommend to save the bambuAnnotations object.

The bambuAnnotation object can be calculated from a *.gtf* file:

```rscript
annotations <- prepareAnnotation(gtf.file)
```

From *TxDb* object

```rscript
annotations <- prepareAnnotations(txdb)
```

---

### Advanced Options

**More stringent filtering thresholds imposed on potential novel transcripts**    
 
- Keep novel transcripts with min 5 read count in at least 1 sample: 

```rscript
bambu(reads, annotations, genome, opt.discovery = list(min.readCount = 5))
```

- Keep novel transcripts with min 5 samples having at least 2 counts:

```rscript
bambu(reads, annotations, genome, opt.discovery = list(min.sampleNumber = 5))
```

- Filter out transcripts with relative abundance within gene lower than 10%: 

```rscript
bambu(reads, annotations, genome, opt.discovery = list(min.readFractionByGene = 0.1))
```

**Quantification without bias correction**     

 The default estimation automatically does bias correction for expression estimates. However, you can choose to perform the quantification without bias correction.

```rscript
bambu(reads, annotations, genome, opt.em = list(bias = FALSE))
```

**Parallel computation**      
 ***bambu***  allows parallel computation.  

```rscript
bambu(reads, annotations, genome, ncore = 8)
```

See [manual](docs/bambu_0.3.0.pdf) for details to customize other conditions.

---

### Complementary functions

**Transcript expression to gene expression**

```rscript
transcriptToGeneExpression(se)
```

**Visualization**

 You can visualize the novel genes/transcripts using ***plotBambu*** function 

```rscript
plotBambu(se, type = "annotation", gene_id)

plotBambu(se, type = "annotation", transcript_id)
```

- ***plotBambu*** can also be used to visualize the clustering of input samples on gene/transcript expressions

```rscript
plotBambu(se, type = "heatmap") # heatmap 

plotBambu(se, type = "pca") # PCA visualization
```

- ***plotBambu*** can also be used to visualize the clustering of input samples on gene/transcript expressions with grouping variable

```rscript
plotBambu(se, type = "heatmap", group.var) # heatmap 

plotBambu(se, type = "pca", group.var) # PCA visualization
```

**Write bambu outputs to files**

- ***writeBambuOutput*** will generate three files, including a *.gtf* file for the extended annotations, and two *.txt* files for the expression counts at transcript and gene levels.

```rscript
writeBambuOutput(se, path = "./bambu/")
```
