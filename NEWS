bambu v1.99.0 (Change date: 2021-10-18)
=============
Major Changes:
    * Implemented a machine learning model to estimate transcript-level novel discovery rate
    * Implemented full length estimates, partial length estimates and unique read counts in final output
    * Improved the performance when extend annotations with simplified codes
    * Improved the performance when large amounts of annotations are missing.
    * Implemented a lowMemory option to allow more efficient processing for very large samples (>100million reads)


Minor fixes:
    * Remove the use of get() which looks into environment variables (prone to crashes if a variable of the same name exists) 
and directly references the functions that should be used instead. 
    * Fixed the error when a .fa file is provided as a string variable in non-windows system
    * Fixed the error when no single exon read class in provided samples
    * Fixed the bug when no splice overlaps found between read class and annotations
